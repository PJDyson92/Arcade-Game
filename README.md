# Phillip Dyson's Arcade Game

## Introduction
This is Project 3 of my Front-End Web Development Nano Degree Course by Udacity.
Project 3 consist of the student to re-create the classic arcade game "Frogger" 
by using javascript.

## How To Play

1.Open the "index.html" to your default web browser.

2.Use the Arrow keys on your keyboard to move the character on the deifferent tiles.

3.Have the character reach to the top of the level on the water to complete the game, 
whilst avoiding the nasty bugs from touching the character.
